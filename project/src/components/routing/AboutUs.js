                    We have been taking the Software Developer Immersive course for 11 weeks and 
                    this web application is the fruit of what we've learned so far!
                    <br/>
                    We hope our karaoke partner have brought you as much laughter as it did for us!
                    Do check out our song recommendations too :)
