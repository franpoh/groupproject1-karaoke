# PREMISE

To create a website where you can search for songs and the accompanying lyrics, then play the song while having a voice reader 'sing' along with you. 

# USER_STORIES

Trello Agile Board: https://trello.com/b/qFzosYZd/project-karaoke

[User Story 1] As a User, I am able to search for music and play it as audio or video, one song at a time with lyrics view, so that I don't need to download the music in my PC to listen to it.
[User Story 2] As a User, I am able to view a catalogue of musics and choose from it, so that I can receive recommendations from the site in case I do not know what to listen to.
[User Story 3] As a User, I am able to trigger artificial singer to sing the song with me using text-to-speech API, so that I can sing along with the artificial singer.
[User Story 4] As a User, I am able to view all historical musics that I have played, so that I am able to refer to a music where I may have forgotten the title.
[User Story 5] As a User, I am able to add a music to my favourite list so that if I enjoyed it, I can refer to it.
[User Story 6] As a User, I am able to navigate the website without difficulty, so that I can have a pleasant user experience.
